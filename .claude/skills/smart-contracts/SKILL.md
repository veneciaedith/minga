description: Stellar smart contract development (Rust, soroban-sdk). Entry point with project setup, contract anatomy, and build/deploy workflow, routing to three companion files in this directory — development.md (storage/TTL, authorization, cross-contract calls, tokens, events, errors, upgrades, fees, troubleshooting), testing.md (unit, fuzz, property, fork, mutation, integration), and security.md (vulnerability classes, checklists, tooling, audits). Use when writing, testing, reviewing, securing, debugging, or shipping Stellar smart contracts, including anything the user calls "Soroban" — Soroban contracts, soroban-sdk, Soroban auth/storage/TTL errors, SEP-41 tokens, or SAC integration from contract code.

# Stellar Smart Contracts

Guide for building Stellar smart contracts in Rust. Smart contracts on Stellar were formerly branded "Soroban" — the platform name is retired, but the Rust SDK (`soroban-sdk`) and several tool names keep the prefix.

This file covers setup and the core workflow. The deep dives live alongside it — **read the file that matches the task**:

| Task | File |
|------|------|
| Storage/TTL, authorization, constructors, cross-contract calls, tokens, events, errors, upgrades, factories, governance/DeFi patterns, fees/resources, troubleshooting | [development.md](development.md) |
| Unit, integration, fuzz, property, fork, and mutation testing | [testing.md](testing.md) |
| Security review, vulnerability classes, checklists, audit prep, tooling | [security.md](security.md) |

## When to use this skill
- Writing a Stellar smart contract in Rust
- Setting up contract tests (any layer)
- Reviewing a contract for security issues
- Architecting upgradeable contracts, factories, custom accounts, or DeFi primitives
- Debugging a contract-specific error (auth, storage, archival, resource limits)

## Versions

This skill was written against **protocol 27** (`soroban-sdk` v27, `rs-soroban-env` v27, `stellar-cli` v27). Version numbers in examples are illustrative — resolve the current ones from these sources rather than trusting any doc:

- **`soroban-sdk` major version tracks the protocol version** (SDK 27 ↔ protocol 27). This rule outlives any specific release.
- Latest SDK release: [crates.io/crates/soroban-sdk](https://crates.io/crates/soroban-sdk) (or `cargo add soroban-sdk`, which resolves it). Pre-releases (`-rc.x`) exist only during a protocol rollout and must be pinned with the exact version string; [GitHub releases](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/releases) lists them with changelogs.
- Networks upgrade by validator vote, testnet before mainnet — pin the SDK major matching the network you deploy to. Live protocol version: RPC `getVersionInfo` or [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org).
- Numeric network limits quoted here are mainnet settings at time of writing; they change by vote — [Stellar Lab's Network Limits page](https://lab.stellar.org/network-limits) and `stellar network settings --network mainnet` show the live values.

## Platform constraints

Contracts are Rust compiled to WebAssembly, run in a sandboxed host:

- `#![no_std]` required — use `soroban_sdk` types (`String`, `Vec`, `Map`, `Symbol`), not the Rust standard library
- Compile for the **`wasm32v1-none`** target (Rust ≥ 1.84) — the only Wasm target the Stellar runtime supports
- 128KB compiled contract size limit (network-configured)
- `Symbol` is limited to 32 characters (`a-zA-Z0-9_`); `symbol_short!()` covers up to 9
- Storage is rented: every entry has a TTL and can be archived — see [development.md](development.md#storage)
- No `delegatecall`, and cross-contract reentrancy is blocked by the host — see [security.md](security.md)
- No I/O, no networking, no clock beyond the ledger timestamp — everything a contract can do hangs off `Env`

## Project setup

```bash
stellar contract init my-contract   # scaffolds a Cargo workspace with contracts/
cd my-contract
rustup target add wasm32v1-none     # once per toolchain
```

`Cargo.toml` essentials (what `stellar contract init` generates):

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["lib", "cdylib"]   # lib is needed for tests and fuzzing

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "27"  # protocol 27, which mainnet runs at the time of writing.
                    # Pre-releases (`-rc.x`) exist only during a rollout and need the
                    # exact version string. Check crates.io for the latest release, and
                    # the live protocol version of your target network, before deploying.

[dev-dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "27", features = ["testutils"] }  # match above

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

## Contract anatomy

One compact example showing state, constructor, auth, TTL, a typed error, and an event:

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{
    contract, contracterror, contractevent, contractimpl, contracttype, Address, Env,
};

#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum DataKey {
    Admin,
    Counter,
}

#[contracterror]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
#[repr(u32)]
pub enum Error {
    NotInitialized = 1,
}

// Emitted as topics ("incremented", by) with data {count} — #[topic] fields
// become topics, the rest go in the data payload.
#[contractevent]
pub struct Incremented {
    #[topic]
    pub by: Address,
    pub count: u32,
}

#[contract]
pub struct CounterContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl CounterContract {
    // Runs once, atomically, at deploy time. Must be named `__constructor`.
    // Does not run again on upgrade.
    pub fn __constructor(env: Env, admin: Address) {
        env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Admin, &admin);
        env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Counter, &0u32);
    }

    pub fn increment(env: Env) -> Result<u32, Error> {
        let admin: Address = env
            .storage()
            .instance()
            .get(&DataKey::Admin)
            .ok_or(Error::NotInitialized)?;
        admin.require_auth();

        let count: u32 = env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Counter).unwrap_or(0);
        let count = count + 1;
        env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Counter, &count);

        // Extend TTL so contract state is not archived (threshold, extend-to)
        env.storage().instance().extend_ttl(120 * 17280, 180 * 17280);

        Incremented { by: admin, count }.publish(&env);
        Ok(count)
    }

    pub fn get_count(env: Env) -> u32 {
        env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Counter).unwrap_or(0)
    }
}
```

Full patterns (three storage types, auth variants, cross-contract calls, tokens, custom types): [development.md](development.md).

## Build, deploy, invoke

```bash
# Build optimized WASM → target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm
# (optimization is on by default; --optimize=false to disable)
stellar contract build

# Create and fund an identity (testnet)
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund

# Deploy (constructor args go after the `--`)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/my_contract.wasm \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  --admin alice

# Invoke
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  increment
```

To upload WASM without instantiating (e.g. for factories or upgrades), use `stellar contract upload` (the older `stellar contract install` is a deprecated alias).

## Minimal test

```rust
// src/test.rs — included from lib.rs with `mod test;`
#![cfg(test)]
use super::*;
use soroban_sdk::{testutils::Address as _, Address, Env};

#[test]
fn test_increment() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();
    let admin = Address::generate(&env);
    let contract_id = env.register(CounterContract, (admin.clone(),));
    let client = CounterContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);
    assert_eq!(client.get_count(), 1);
}
```

Auth mocking, event assertions, fuzzing, fork tests, and CI setup: [testing.md](testing.md).

## Before mainnet

Work through the checklists in [security.md](security.md) — authorization, reinitialization, arithmetic, storage TTLs, and cross-contract validation are the recurring failure modes.
