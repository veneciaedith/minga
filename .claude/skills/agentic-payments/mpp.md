# MPP — Machine Payments Protocol (Charge + Session)

MPP is a payment-method-agnostic HTTP 402 protocol, not a Stellar-only one: the core protocol standardizes the 402 Challenge/Credential exchange, and each **payment method** defines how one network settles it ([protocol spec](https://mpp.dev/protocol)). Tempo, Stripe and EVM are other payment methods; this guide documents the [Stellar payment method](https://mpp.dev/payment-methods/stellar). The packages split the same way: `mppx` is the general MPP framework, and `@stellar/mpp` is the Stellar payment method that extends it.

Facilitator-free machine payments settled directly on Stellar: per-request Charge mode and channel-backed Session mode. Companion to [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) (decision table, shared testnet setup, USDC addresses); the facilitator-based alternative lives in [x402.md](x402.md).

## When to use MPP
MPP is the right choice when:
- You want **no facilitator dependency** — payments settle directly on Stellar via SAC transfers
- Your AI agent makes **many requests per session** — use Session mode (a payment channel under the hood) to pay off-chain and settle once
- You're building a Stellar-native payment stack without relying on third-party infrastructure

Two modes:

| Mode | On-chain txs | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Charge** | One per request | Per-request payments, no pre-funding required |
| **Session** | One deposit + one close | High-frequency agents (100s of requests/session) |

If you need zero-XLM clients or the simplest possible setup, use x402 ([x402.md](x402.md)) instead.

## Charge mode: per-request payments

Each request triggers a SAC token transfer settled on-chain. No facilitator. Server can optionally sponsor fees so clients don't need XLM.

```bash
npm install express@^5 @stellar/mpp mppx@^0.6.31 @stellar/stellar-sdk@^15 dotenv
npm pkg set type=module
```

> **Version alignment matters:** `@stellar/mpp@0.7.x` pins `@stellar/stellar-sdk@^15.1.0` (installing alongside SDK 13/14 fails with `ERESOLVE`) and `peerDependencies.mppx: ^0.6.29` — pin `mppx@^0.6.31` explicitly, since an unpinned install resolves the latest `mppx` (0.9.x), which falls outside that peer range and also adds a `SecretKey.assert()` guard this doc's "no intent's setup may throw at import time" guarantee assumes isn't there yet. `mppx` also expects `express@>=5`.

**Server:**

```js
// charge-server.js
import express from "express";
import { Mppx } from "mppx/express";
import { Store } from "mppx/server";
import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/charge/server";
import * as StellarSdk from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const USDC_SAC_TESTNET = "CBIELTK6YBZJU5UP2WWQEUCYKLPU6AUNZ2BQ4WWFEIE3USCIHMXQDAMA";
const RECIPIENT = process.env.STELLAR_RECIPIENT; // G... address

const mppx = Mppx.create({
  secretKey: process.env.MPP_SECRET_KEY, // shared secret for credential verification
  methods: [
    stellar.charge({
      recipient: RECIPIENT,
      currency: USDC_SAC_TESTNET,
      network: "stellar:testnet",
      store: Store.memory(), // required in charge mode; dev only — use a persistent store in production
      // optional: server pays network fees so clients don't need XLM
      feePayer: process.env.FEE_PAYER_SECRET
        ? { envelopeSigner: StellarSdk.Keypair.fromSecret(process.env.FEE_PAYER_SECRET) }
        : undefined,
    }),
  ],
});

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Mppx.create returns per-intent Express handlers — mount one per paid route.
// The price is set here, per route, not in the method config.
app.get(
  "/data",
  mppx.charge({ amount: "0.001", description: "paid API call" }),
  (req, res) => {
    res.json({ result: "paid content", price: "$0.001 USDC" });
  },
);

app.listen(3002, () => console.log("MPP charge server on http://localhost:3002"));
```

**Client:**

```js
// charge-client.js
import { Mppx } from "@stellar/mpp/charge/client"; // re-exports the client Mppx from mppx/client
import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/charge/client";
import * as StellarSdk from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const keypair = StellarSdk.Keypair.fromSecret(process.env.STELLAR_SECRET_KEY);

const mppx = Mppx.create({
  methods: [
    stellar.charge({
      keypair,
      mode: "pull", // server assembles and broadcasts the transaction
      onProgress(event) {
        // event.type: "challenge" | "signing" | "signed" | "paying" | "confirming" | "paid"
        if (event.type === "paid") console.log("Paid:", event.hash);
      },
    }),
  ],
});

// mppx wraps fetch — 402 handling is transparent
const res = await mppx.fetch("http://localhost:3002/data");
console.log(await res.json());
```

**Env vars (server):** `STELLAR_RECIPIENT`, `MPP_SECRET_KEY`, `FEE_PAYER_SECRET` (optional)
**Env vars (client):** `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY`

> **`MPP_SECRET_KEY` must be at least 32 bytes.** `mppx@0.6.31`'s `Mppx.create()` only checks it's present, not its length — a one-character value is accepted and then signs every HMAC challenge. Generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`. (`mppx@0.9.x` adds this check itself via `SecretKey.assert()`; pinned to `0.6.31` per the install note above, this doc's own examples don't get it for free.)

**`mode: "pull"` vs `"push"`:**
- `"pull"` — client signs auth entries, server assembles + broadcasts (default; use with `feePayer`)
- `"push"` — client builds and broadcasts the transaction directly (client must have XLM for fees)

## Session mode: high-frequency off-chain payments

> **Naming:** current MPP material calls the payment intent a **Session**; it settles over a **one-way payment channel**. Older docs (including earlier versions of this skill) said "Channel mode" — treat that as a synonym. "Channel" below always refers to the settlement mechanism, not the mode.

The client deploys a one-way payment channel contract, deposits USDC once, then signs **cumulative commitments** off-chain for each request. No transaction per request — only two on-chain txs total (deposit + close). Ideal for AI agents making hundreds of calls in a session.

### Session lifecycle

```
1. Deploy channel contract (one-time)   → C... contract address
2. Client deposits USDC into channel    → on-chain tx
3. Per request: client signs commitment → off-chain (just a signature)
   Amount is cumulative: each sig covers all previous payments + this one
4. Server closes channel when done      → on-chain tx, settles total
```

### Prerequisites

- Deploy a one-way-channel smart contract to get a `C...` contract address
- Generate an ed25519 keypair for commitment signing (see [stellar-mpp SDK](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-mpp-sdk))
- Fund the channel with USDC before making requests

### Server:

```js
// channel-server.js
import express from "express";
import { Mppx } from "mppx/express";
import { Store } from "mppx/server";
import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/channel/server";
import { StrKey } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const USDC_SAC_TESTNET = "CBIELTK6YBZJU5UP2WWQEUCYKLPU6AUNZ2BQ4WWFEIE3USCIHMXQDAMA";

// commitmentKey must be a Stellar G... address (or a Keypair) — never raw
// ed25519 bytes. MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY is generated and stored as 64-char hex
// (see the testnet runbook), so re-encode it before handing it to the library.
// Validate the raw string, not the decoded length: Buffer.from(x, "hex")
// stops at the first invalid hex character instead of throwing, so 64
// valid chars followed by garbage still decodes to exactly 32 bytes — a
// length check on the buffer can't catch that. StrKey.encodeEd25519PublicKey()
// doesn't check length either, so a bad value would otherwise silently
// become a plausible-looking wrong G... address instead of an error.
if (!/^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i.test(process.env.MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY)) {
  throw new Error("MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY must be exactly 64 hex characters");
}
const commitmentKey = StrKey.encodeEd25519PublicKey(
  Buffer.from(process.env.MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY, "hex")
);

const mppx = Mppx.create({
  secretKey: process.env.MPP_SECRET_KEY,
  methods: [
    stellar.channel({
      channel: process.env.MPP_CHANNEL_CONTRACT,       // C... contract address
      commitmentKey,
      // Both optional but strongly recommended: the channel contract is
      // deployed out-of-band, so without these the library can't reject a
      // channel that would settle to someone else's account or pay out in
      // the wrong token — it only logs a startup warning and trusts the
      // on-chain contract.
      recipient: process.env.STELLAR_RECIPIENT,        // reused from charge mode
      currency: USDC_SAC_TESTNET,
      store: Store.memory(), // dev only — use persistent store in production
      network: "stellar:testnet",
    }),
  ],
});

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Per-route handler, same adapter model as charge mode; price per route.
app.get(
  "/data",
  mppx.channel({ amount: "0.001", description: "paid API call" }),
  (req, res) => {
    res.json({ result: "paid content" });
  },
);

app.listen(3003);
```

### Client:

```js
// channel-client.js
import { Mppx } from "mppx/client";
import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/channel/client";
import * as StellarSdk from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

// commitment key must be a raw ed25519 seed — NOT a standard Stellar secret key
const commitmentKey = StellarSdk.Keypair.fromRawEd25519Seed(
  Buffer.from(process.env.COMMITMENT_SECRET, "hex") // 64-char hex secret
);

const mppx = Mppx.create({
  methods: [
    stellar.channel({
      commitmentKey,
      onProgress(event) {
        // event.type: "challenge" | "signed"
      },
    }),
  ],
});

// Make many requests — each signs a cumulative off-chain commitment
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  const res = await mppx.fetch("http://localhost:3003/data");
  console.log(i, await res.json());
}
```

### Closing the channel (server-initiated):

```js
import { close } from "@stellar/mpp/channel/server";
import * as StellarSdk from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const txHash = await close({
  channel: process.env.MPP_CHANNEL_CONTRACT,
  amount: lastCumulativeAmount, // bigint, total USDC owed in base units
  signature: lastCommitmentSignature, // hex string from final commitment
  feePayer: { envelopeSigner: StellarSdk.Keypair.fromSecret(process.env.FEE_PAYER_SECRET) },
  network: "stellar:testnet",
});
// Single on-chain transaction settles the full session
console.log("Channel closed:", txHash);
```

**Env vars (server):** `MPP_CHANNEL_CONTRACT`, `MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY`, `STELLAR_RECIPIENT`, `MPP_SECRET_KEY`, `FEE_PAYER_SECRET`
**Env vars (client):** `COMMITMENT_SECRET`

> `MPP_SECRET_KEY` carries the same 32-byte minimum here as in Charge mode above — see the note there.

## Production patterns

Three patterns for running Charge and Session behind the same server,
verified against a service that's been billing real USDC over MPP Charge
in production since before this skill existed.

### Recipient resolution (recover at boot, fail closed per request)

Two failure modes hit real deployments: `STELLAR_RECIPIENT` isn't set
yet (CI, a fresh environment before secrets are provisioned), or it's
set to the wrong value — a secret key (`S...`) pasted where the public
key belongs, which happens more than you'd expect when a platform's env
var UI doesn't visually distinguish the two. Neither should crash the
server at import time — but neither should let a paid route respond for
free once the server is up. Those are two separate failure surfaces:
booting and billing.

```js
import { Keypair, StrKey } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

function resolveRecipient() {
  let raw = (process.env.STELLAR_RECIPIENT || "").trim().replace(/['"]/g, "");
  if (!raw) return "";

  if (raw.startsWith("S")) {
    // A secret key was set where the public key belongs — recover instead
    // of failing. Warn loudly; this should get fixed, not silently relied on.
    try {
      const pub = Keypair.fromSecret(raw).publicKey();
      console.warn(`STELLAR_RECIPIENT is a secret key — derived public key: ${pub.slice(0, 8)}...`);
      return pub;
    } catch {
      console.error("STELLAR_RECIPIENT looks like a secret key but failed to parse — disabling MPP");
      return "";
    }
  }

  // A typo'd G... (wrong length, bad checksum) used to reach the SDK
  // unvalidated and throw several frames deep in Mppx.create(), away from
  // the env var that actually caused it. Fail here instead, with context.
  if (!StrKey.isValidEd25519PublicKey(raw)) {
    console.error(`STELLAR_RECIPIENT is not a valid Stellar public key — disabling MPP: ${raw.slice(0, 8)}...`);
    return "";
  }

  return raw;
}

const RECIPIENT = resolveRecipient();

let chargeMppx = null;
if (RECIPIENT && process.env.MPP_SECRET_KEY) {
  chargeMppx = Mppx.create({ /* ... */ });
} else {
  console.warn("MPP_SECRET_KEY missing, or STELLAR_RECIPIENT missing or invalid — MPP charge middleware disabled");
}

// Every route's middleware checks the instance, not the env var directly.
// Fail CLOSED here, not open: a rotated secret or a misconfigured deploy
// must never turn a paid route into a free one. `next()` would let the
// route respond with its normal 200 and no charge at all — indistinguishable
// from a bug, and silent.
export function mppChargeMiddleware(amount, description) {
  return async (req, res, next) => {
    if (!chargeMppx) {
      res.setHeader("X-MPP-Warning", "MPP not configured on this server");
      res.status(503).json({ error: "MPP charge unavailable — payment middleware not initialized" });
      return;
    }
    // Delegate to the same per-route handler the standalone Charge server
    // example above mounts directly (mppx.charge({ amount, description })),
    // just called manually here instead of passed to app.get() — this
    // factory's whole job is the null-check above it, not a different
    // charge implementation.
    await chargeMppx.charge({ amount, description })(req, res, next);
  };
}
```

The `S...`-key recovery is the case worth stealing even if you don't
need the rest: it turns a silent misconfiguration into a loud warning
plus an explicit `503`, instead of either a `Keypair.fromPublicKey` throw
three layers down in the SDK with no context about which env var caused
it, or — worse — a paid route quietly serving its content for free
because there was nothing left to charge against it.

### Optional dual-intent server

Charge and Session don't have to be an either/or choice at the code
level. Give each mode its own `Mppx` instance, initialize it only when
its full config is present, and let each intent's own middleware fail
closed — never throw, and never let the route respond for free — when
the instance for that intent is `null`. Charge's and
Session's server adapters both export their namespace as `stellar` (see
the Charge and Channel server imports above), so combining them in one
file means aliasing one — here Channel's becomes `stellarChannel`:

```js
import { Mppx } from "mppx/express";
import { Store } from "mppx/server";
import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/charge/server";
import * as stellarChannel from "@stellar/mpp/channel/server";
import { Keypair, StrKey } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const USDC_SAC_TESTNET = "CBIELTK6YBZJU5UP2WWQEUCYKLPU6AUNZ2BQ4WWFEIE3USCIHMXQDAMA";

// RECIPIENT is the resolveRecipient() result from the pattern above.

const chargeMppx = (RECIPIENT && process.env.MPP_SECRET_KEY)
  ? Mppx.create({ methods: [stellar.charge({ recipient: RECIPIENT, /* ... */ })] })
  : null;

// Same hex -> G-address re-encoding as the Session server example above,
// but this section's whole point is that no intent's setup may throw at
// import time or take another intent down with it — chargeMppx above must
// stay up even if MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY is garbage. So this catches instead
// of throwing: log it, leave commitmentKey undefined, and let the gate
// below fail Session closed (sessionMppx stays null) exactly the same way
// a genuinely-unset env var already does. Validates the raw string, not
// the decoded length — Buffer.from(x, "hex") stops at the first invalid
// character instead of throwing, so 64 valid chars followed by garbage
// still decodes to exactly 32 bytes.
let commitmentKey;
if (process.env.MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY) {
  if (/^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i.test(process.env.MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY)) {
    commitmentKey = StrKey.encodeEd25519PublicKey(
      Buffer.from(process.env.MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY, "hex")
    );
  } else {
    console.error("MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY is not 64 hex characters — Session mode disabled, Charge unaffected");
  }
}

// Same pattern as commitmentKey above: validate the raw string before
// handing it to Keypair.fromSecret(), which throws on a malformed secret
// key. Unvalidated, that throw happens inside the Mppx.create() call
// below — at import time, taking chargeMppx down with it. Unlike Charge
// (where feePayer is genuinely optional — see the ternary in the Charge
// server example above), Session's own env var list two sections up
// already lists FEE_PAYER_SECRET without "(optional)", and
// channel.Parameters' own doc comment says feePayer is "Required when
// handling close credential actions" — so this validates it, rather than
// treating it as optional the way Charge's ternary does.
let feePayerSigner;
if (process.env.FEE_PAYER_SECRET) {
  if (StrKey.isValidEd25519SecretSeed(process.env.FEE_PAYER_SECRET)) {
    feePayerSigner = Keypair.fromSecret(process.env.FEE_PAYER_SECRET);
  } else {
    console.error("FEE_PAYER_SECRET is not a valid Stellar secret key — Session mode disabled, Charge unaffected");
  }
}

// Same validate-before-use pattern as commitmentKey and feePayerSigner
// above: channel() only validates store, not the channel address itself
// — a typo'd C... value still builds sessionMppx, /info still reports
// Session enabled, and the address only reaches `new Contract(...)`
// deep inside the SDK on the first paid request, where it throws
// "Invalid contract ID" instead of failing at boot the way this whole
// section exists to guarantee.
let channelAddress;
if (process.env.MPP_CHANNEL_CONTRACT) {
  if (StrKey.isValidContract(process.env.MPP_CHANNEL_CONTRACT)) {
    channelAddress = process.env.MPP_CHANNEL_CONTRACT;
  } else {
    console.error("MPP_CHANNEL_CONTRACT is not a valid Stellar contract ID — Session mode disabled, Charge unaffected");
  }
}

const sessionMppx = (
  channelAddress &&
  commitmentKey &&
  RECIPIENT &&
  process.env.MPP_SECRET_KEY &&
  feePayerSigner
)
  ? Mppx.create({
      methods: [
        stellarChannel.channel({
          channel: channelAddress,
          commitmentKey,
          // Strongly recommended, not just optional: RECIPIENT is already a
          // precondition to reach this branch, so wire it through instead of
          // leaving the channel's payout address unverified against it.
          recipient: RECIPIENT,
          currency: USDC_SAC_TESTNET,
          // Required, not optional, in channel.Parameters — same as Charge
          // mode's own store above, already shown in full in the standalone
          // Charge and Session server examples earlier in this file.
          // Omitting it here throws at construction time (inside this same
          // ternary), which is exactly the "no intent's setup may throw"
          // rule this section exists to enforce.
          store: Store.memory(), // dev only — use a persistent store in production
          feePayer: { envelopeSigner: feePayerSigner },
          /* ... */
        }),
      ],
    })
  : null;

export const isSessionEnabled = () => !!sessionMppx;

// Same shape as mppChargeMiddleware above, and for the same reason: a
// route wired up the way the standalone Session server example higher in
// this file shows — sessionMppx.channel({ amount, description }) called
// directly as route middleware — evaluates that call at route
// registration time, which runs at import time. With sessionMppx `null`
// (Session not configured), that throws immediately and takes the whole
// process down, chargeMppx included — exactly what this section's "no
// intent's setup may throw or take another down with it" rule exists to
// prevent. Route through this factory instead of calling sessionMppx
// directly.
export function mppSessionMiddleware(amount, description) {
  return async (req, res, next) => {
    if (!sessionMppx) {
      res.setHeader("X-MPP-Warning", "MPP Session not configured on this server");
      res.status(503).json({ error: "MPP session unavailable — payment middleware not initialized" });
      return;
    }
    // Same delegation as mppChargeMiddleware above, to the Channel
    // equivalent of the standalone server example's mppx.channel({...}).
    await sessionMppx.channel({ amount, description })(req, res, next);
  };
}
```

This is the pattern actually running in production: Charge mode is
initialized and billing; Session mode's instance is `null` there today,
by choice — it requires deploying and funding a channel contract per
deployment, a step that carries custody implications worth a compliance
pass before turning on for a given business. Session works the same way
Charge does once its five env vars are set; nothing in the server code
changes when you flip it on later. What this pattern buys you is
shipping Charge on day one without a rewrite pending.

### Runtime configuration-status endpoint (`/info`)

Not the OpenAPI discovery document below, and not a health check either —
call it that and a caller will expect it to confirm the Soroban RPC, the
facilitator, and the store backend it depends on are actually reachable
right now. It doesn't: it only reports whether each intent's `Mppx`
instance was constructed at startup, which is configuration state, not
live dependency health. A client (human or agent) shouldn't have to guess
which intents are live. Report the true initialization state, not a
static capability list — `enabled` reflects whether the instance actually
initialized:

```js
app.get("/info", (_req, res) => {
  res.json({
    protocol: "mpp",
    intents: {
      charge: {
        enabled: !!chargeMppx,
        routes: { data: { path: "/data", price: "0.001 USDC" } },
      },
      session: {
        enabled: isSessionEnabled(),
        // channelAddress, not process.env.MPP_CHANNEL_CONTRACT directly — channelAddress
        // is undefined when the raw env var failed StrKey.isValidContract() above, so a
        // rejected value shows null here instead of appearing valid beside enabled: false.
        channelContract: channelAddress || null,
        note: "Off-chain cumulative commitments, two on-chain txs total (deposit + close).",
      },
    },
  });
});
```

An agent that reads this before its first request can pick a configured
intent instead of finding out from a 503 that Session was never
configured.

## Discovery: let agents find your paid API

Charge and Session modes answer one question: how do I charge? Discovery answers a second: how does a paying agent find me? Without discovery you ship a working paid API that no agent can locate.

A paid MPP server publishes an [OpenAPI 3.1](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) document at `GET /openapi.json`. Each paid operation carries an `x-payment-info` extension holding an `offers[]` array. Registries aggregate those documents so agents can search for paid APIs.

> **Discovery is advisory.** The document is an informational hint for display and planning. The runtime **402 Challenge is authoritative** for price, token, network, expiry, and terms. Read the payment terms from the Challenge, never from the discovery document.

### Serve the document

`mppx/express` exports `discovery()`. It mounts `GET /openapi.json` and derives each offer from the method config and the per-route handler, so the document stays in step with the Challenges the route returns.

Edit the Charge mode server above — don't append this to it. A second `mppx/express` import redeclares `Mppx`, and a second `/data` route never runs.

```js
// charge-server.js

// 1. Replace the existing `mppx/express` import with this one.
import { Mppx, discovery } from "mppx/express";

// 2. Replace the inline app.get("/data", ...) block with these two.
//    discovery() reads the price off the handler object, so name it.
const pay = mppx.charge({ amount: "0.001", description: "paid API call" });

app.get("/data", pay, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ result: "paid content", price: "$0.001 USDC" });
});

// 3. Add this after the route, before app.listen().
discovery(app, mppx, {
  info: { title: "Paid Data API", version: "1.0.0" },
  routes: [{ handler: pay, method: "get", path: "/data" }],
});
```

Session mode works the same way — pass the `mppx.channel(...)` handler in `routes`.

Validate the document before you publish it:

```bash
npx mppx discover validate http://localhost:3002/openapi.json
```

### Register the service (optional)

| Registry | What it is | How to list |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| [MPPScan](https://mppscan.com) | Public registry of MPP services, with search and analytics | [Register](https://www.mppscan.com/register) |
| [MPP services directory](https://mpp.dev/services) | Curated list of live services on mpp.dev | [Submission guide](https://mpp.dev/services#list-your-service) |

Agents can query the curated directory over MCP at `https://mpp.dev/mcp/services`. That server is read-only.

A registry listing advertises your service. It does not verify any client payment. Your server still issues the 402 Challenge and verifies the Credential on every request.

Pinned for the same reason as the Charge mode install above: `@stellar/mpp@0.7.1` declares `peerDependencies` of `mppx: ^0.6.29` and `@stellar/stellar-sdk: ^15.1.0`, but unpinned resolves each package's `latest` tag today (`mppx@0.9.2`, `@stellar/stellar-sdk@17.0.1`) — both outside those ranges, so an unpinned install fails with `ERESOLVE`.

| Import path | Recommended import pattern |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| `@stellar/mpp/charge/server` | `import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/charge/server"` — use `stellar.charge(...)` |
| `@stellar/mpp/charge/client` | `import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/charge/client"` — use `stellar.charge(...)` |
| `@stellar/mpp/channel/server` | `import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/channel/server"` — use `stellar.channel(...)`, `stellar.close(...)`, `stellar.getChannelState(...)`, `stellar.watchChannel(...)` |
| `@stellar/mpp/channel/client` | `import * as stellar from "@stellar/mpp/channel/client"` — use `stellar.channel(...)` |
| `@stellar/mpp/channel` | Zod schema definitions for channel types |
| `mppx/express` | `import { Mppx, discovery } from "mppx/express"` — Express adapter; `Mppx.create(...)` returns per-route handlers, `discovery(...)` mounts `/openapi.json` |
| `mppx/server` | `import { Mppx, Store } from "mppx/server"` — framework-agnostic server + `Store` |
| `mppx/client` | `import { Mppx } from "mppx/client"` — client; also re-exported by `@stellar/mpp/charge/client` |

> The bare `mppx` root does **not** export `Mppx` at all — always import it from the subpaths above. (`Store` *is* re-exported from the root and is the same object as `mppx/server`'s, but importing it from `mppx/server` keeps the server imports together.)

## Testnet runbook

**Steps shared with all protocols:**
1. Generate keypair + fund with Friendbot — see the [shared testnet setup in SKILL.md](SKILL.md#testnet-setup-shared)
2. Add USDC trustline (same shared setup)
3. Get testnet USDC from [Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/)

**Session mode only:**
4. Deploy the one-way-channel contract (see [stellar-mpp-sdk](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-mpp-sdk) for deploy script)
5. Generate a 64-char hex ed25519 seed for the commitment key — this value
   is `COMMITMENT_SECRET`, kept on the **client** only:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```
6. Derive the corresponding public key from that same seed — this is
   `MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY`, what the **server** holds, stored as hex the same
   way (the server code above re-encodes it to a G... address at startup).
   Export the seed from step 5 first, then read it from the environment
   rather than passing it as a bare CLI argument:
   ```bash
   export COMMITMENT_SECRET="<64-char hex from step 5>"
   node -e "const {Keypair}=require('@stellar/stellar-sdk');const seed=Buffer.from(process.env.COMMITMENT_SECRET,'hex');console.log(Keypair.fromRawEd25519Seed(seed).rawPublicKey().toString('hex'))"
   ```
   Then fund the channel with USDC before making requests.

## Common pitfalls

**Charge: server throws `A store is required for charge mode` at startup**
- Symptom: `Error: [stellar:charge] A store is required for charge mode. Provide a Store instance…`
- Fix: pass `store: Store.memory()` (dev) or a persistent store to `stellar.charge({ ... })` — charge mode requires one, not just session mode.

**Install fails with `ERESOLVE`**
- Symptom: npm refuses to install `@stellar/mpp` alongside an existing stellar-sdk 13/14, or alongside an unpinned `mppx`
- Fix: `@stellar/mpp@0.7.x` pins `@stellar/stellar-sdk@^15.1.0` and `peerDependencies.mppx: ^0.6.29`, and `mppx` expects `express@>=5` — align versions per the install note above, including the `mppx@^0.6.31` pin (an unpinned install resolves the latest 0.9.x, outside that peer range).

**Session: wrong commitment key format**
- Symptom: `Keypair.fromRawEd25519Seed` throws or signatures fail to verify
- Fix: two different 64-char hex values, not a Stellar `S...` secret key and not interchangeable. `COMMITMENT_SECRET` (client only) is the raw ed25519 **seed** — generate with `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`. `MPP_COMMITMENT_KEY` (server) is the **public key** derived from that same seed, hex-encoded the same way — never the seed itself. See the testnet runbook above for the derivation step.

**Session: non-cumulative amounts**
- Symptom: server rejects commitments after the first request
- Fix: each commitment's `amount` must be the **running total** of all payments so far, not just the price of the current request. The server tracks the highest-seen commitment.

**Session: deposit TTL expired**
- Symptom: `close()` fails or channel appears drained
- Fix: Contract storage has a TTL. Close the channel before it expires, or extend storage TTL via `bumpContractInstance`. Don't leave channels open indefinitely.

**Charge: client has no XLM for fees**
- Symptom: `op_insufficient_balance` or fee errors on client-submitted transactions
- Fix: set `mode: "pull"` on the client and configure `feePayer` on the server so the server pays fees. The client only signs auth entries.

**Discovery: client trusts the discovery price**
- Symptom: the client pays the amount from `/openapi.json` and the server rejects the Credential
- Fix: the discovery document is advisory. Take price, token, network, expiry, and terms from the 402 Challenge.

**Discovery: route missing from `/openapi.json`**
- Symptom: the document builds, but a paid route carries no `x-payment-info`
- Fix: on Express, `discovery()` only documents routes listed in `routes`. Add one entry per paid route, and pass the same handler object you mounted on the route.

**`Store.memory()` in production**
- Symptom: server loses track of channel state on restart, enables double-spend
- Fix: replace `Store.memory()` with a persistent store (database-backed) before going to production.
